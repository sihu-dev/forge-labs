- **Drive engagement** (likes, comments, shares)
- **Build authority** (thought leadership)

---

## Platform Specifications

### LinkedIn

**Optimal Format**:
- **Length**: 1200-1500 characters (sweet spot for engagement)
- **Structure**: Hook → Body → CTA
- **Paragraphs**: 1-2 sentences max (mobile readability)
- **Line breaks**: Use generously (white space increases readability)

**Best Posting Times** (EST):
- Tuesday: 8:00 AM - 10:00 AM
- Wednesday: 9:00 AM - 11:00 AM
- Thursday: 8:00 AM - 10:00 AM

**Hashtag Strategy**:
- **Count**: 3-5 hashtags
- **Placement**: End of post (not inline)

**Engagement Tactics**:
- Ask questions (end with "What's your experience?")
- Tag relevant people (max 2-3)
- Respond to comments within first hour
- Create polls (higher reach than text posts)

**Content Pillars** (rotate):

3. **Engagement** (20%): Questions, polls, hot takes
4. **Promotional** (10%): Product updates, case studies

---

### Twitter/X

**Thread Format**:
- **Length**: 8-12 tweets (optimal for engagement)
- **Tweet 1**: Pure hook (no context, max curiosity)
- **Tweets 2-9**: Core content (one idea per tweet)
- **Tweet 10**: Summary + CTA
- **Tweet 11** (optional): "If you found this helpful, follow me @handle for more"

**Character Limits**:
- **Max**: 280 characters per tweet
- **Optimal**: 240-260 (leaves room for RTs with comments)

**Formatting**:
- **Line breaks**: 1 per tweet (improves readability)
- **Emojis**: 1-2 per thread (not every tweet)
- **Numbers**: Use for listicles (1/, 2/, 3/)
- **Hashtags**: ONLY in last tweet (algorithm downranks multi-hashtag tweets)

**Best Posting Times** (EST):
- Monday-Friday: 9:00 AM, 12:00 PM, 5:00 PM
- Avoid: Late nights, weekends (lower engagement)

**Engagement Tactics**:
- End with a question ("What's your take?")
- Reply to your own thread with bonus content
- Quote tweet yourself after 2 hours to resurface
- Pin high-performing threads to profile

### Reddit

**Subreddit Strategy**:
- **Primary**: r/SaaS, r/Entrepreneur, r/webdev, r/IndieBiz
- **Niche**: r/buildinpublic, r/microsaas, r/sideproject

**Tone**:
- **Ultra-casual**: "So I built this thing..."
- **Community-first**: Help, don't promote
- **Humble**: Downplay success, highlight learnings

**Self-Promotion Limits**:
- **Rule of thumb**: 9 helpful posts for every 1 self-promotional
- **Allowed**: Sharing learnings with project mention in comments
- **Forbidden**: "Check out my product" in title

**Format**:
```markdown
# {Intriguing but not clickbait title}

{Story or problem statement}

{What you tried}

{What worked}

{Specific results with numbers}

{Ask for feedback or share code/resources}

---

**Edit**: Thanks for the gold! Happy to answer questions in comments.
```

**Karma-Building Strategy**:
- Comment on new posts in target subreddits (10+ per week)
- Provide genuinely helpful answers
- Build reputation before promoting

## Hashtag Research

### LinkedIn Hashtag Strategy

**Tiers**:
1. **Mega** (1M+ followers): #SaaS, #Entrepreneurship, #Technology
2. **Popular** (100K-1M): #IndieHackers, #BootstrappedBusiness, #NoCode
3. **Niche** (10K-100K): #MicroSaaS, #BuildInPublic, #SoloFounder

**Formula**: 1 Mega + 2 Popular + 2 Niche

**How to Find**:
- Search target keyword on LinkedIn
- Check "Top Hashtags" in results
- Analyze competitors' top-performing posts
- Track engagement per hashtag over time

### Twitter/X Hashtag Strategy

**Rule**: Avoid hashtags in main tweets (algorithm downranks)

**Exception**: Only in last tweet of thread (if relevant to trending topic)

**Trending Topics**:
- Check Twitter Trends daily
- Jump on relevant trends early (<2 hours old)
- Add your unique take, not just a hot take

---

## Engagement Optimization

### Timing

**LinkedIn**:
- Publish Tuesday-Thursday between 8-10 AM EST
- Avoid Monday mornings (inbox overwhelm) and Fridays (checked out)

**Twitter**:
- Threads: Post at 9 AM EST (peak engagement for tech audience)
- Single tweets: 12 PM and 5 PM EST (lunch and commute times)

**Reddit**:
- Tuesday-Thursday mornings (6-9 AM EST) for maximum visibility
- Avoid weekends (lower engagement in tech subreddits)

### First Hour Response Strategy

**Why**: LinkedIn/Twitter algorithms prioritize posts with early engagement

**Tactics**:
1. **LinkedIn**: Respond to every comment in first hour → boosts reach
2. **Twitter**: Like + reply to quote tweets → encourages more QTs
3. **Reddit**: Reply to questions immediately → builds credibility

### A/B Testing

**Test variables** (one at a time):
- Hook (curiosity vs. controversy)
- Length (short vs. long-form)
- CTA (question vs. statement)
- Emoji usage (none vs. 1-2)

**Track**:
- Impressions
- Engagement rate (likes + comments / impressions)
- Click-through rate (for posts with links)
- Follower gain

---
