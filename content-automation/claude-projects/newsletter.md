```

**Examples**:

```

**Examples**:

## A/B Testing Strategy

### What to Test

**Priority 1: Subject Lines**
```yaml
Test_1:
  variant_a: "How to automate content creation"
  variant_b: "The content automation stack I use"
  hypothesis: "Specific ('I use') beats generic ('How to')"
  metric: "Open rate"
```

**Priority 2: CTA Placement**
```yaml
Test_2:
  variant_a: "CTA at end of email"
  variant_b: "CTA mid-email + end"
  hypothesis: "Multiple CTAs increase clicks"
  metric: "Click-through rate"
```

**Priority 3: Email Length**
```yaml
Test_3:
  variant_a: "500 words"
  variant_b: "250 words (trimmed)"
  hypothesis: "Shorter = higher engagement"
  metric: "Read time + CTR"
```

### Testing Calendar

**Week 1**: Subject line (curiosity vs. benefit)
**Week 2**: Preview text (with vs. without)
**Week 3**: CTA copy ("Read more" vs. "Get the guide")
**Week 4**: Email length (long vs. short)

**Rotate**: Don't test same variable back-to-back

### Winning Criteria

**Open Rate**:
- Baseline: 30%
- Winner: +5% absolute improvement (e.g., 30% → 35%)

**Click-Through Rate**:
- Baseline: 5%
- Winner: +2% absolute improvement (e.g., 5% → 7%)

**Implement winner**: If confident after 2 consecutive tests

## Email Design & Formatting

### Plain Text vs. HTML

**Use Plain Text**:
- Personal newsletters from founder
- 1-on-1 feeling
- Higher deliverability
- Mobile-friendly

**Use HTML**:
- Product announcements (need images/buttons)
- Curated digests (better visual hierarchy)
- Newsletters with ads/sponsors

**Hybrid Approach** (Recommended):
- Mostly plain text
- Minimal styling (bold, italic, links)
- 1-2 images max
- HTML for CTA button only

### Formatting Rules

**Line Length**: 60-70 characters (improves readability)

**Paragraphs**: 2-3 sentences max

**White Space**: Double line breaks between sections

**Bold**: For subheadings and key phrases

**Links**:
```markdown
❌ Click here: https://example.com/very-long-url
✅ [Descriptive anchor text](https://example.com/url)
```

**Code Blocks**:
```
Use triple backticks for code

```javascript
const example = 'formatted code';
```
```

**Lists**:
```markdown
Numbered (for steps):
1. First action
2. Second action

Bullet (for options):
- Option A
- Option B
```

---

## Call-to-Action (CTA) Strategy

### CTA Types

**1. Read More (Blog Post)**
```
📖 Read the full guide →
[Link: blog.example.com/post]
```

**2. Try Tool**
```
🛠️ Try it free for 14 days
[Button: Start Free Trial]
```

**3. Engage**
```
💬 Reply to this email - I read every response
```

**4. Share**
```
Know someone who'd find this useful?
[Forward this email](mailto:?subject=Check%20this%20out)
```

**5. Feedback**
```
📊 Quick poll: Was this helpful?
[Yes, send more](link) | [No, not for me](link)
```

### CTA Best Practices

**Clarity**:
- ❌ "Learn more"
- ✅ "Get the free template"

**Urgency** (when appropriate):
- "Closes tonight at midnight"
- "Only 10 spots left"

**Value-First**:
- ❌ "Buy my course"
- ✅ "Get instant access to 50 automation templates"

**Single Primary CTA**:
- 1 main action per email
- Secondary CTAs okay (reply, unsubscribe)

That's totally okay - inboxes are crowded.

But I wanted to check in:

Are these emails still useful to you?

[Yes, keep sending](link) | [No, unsubscribe](link)

{Your Name}
```

**Email 2** (After 90 days no open):
```markdown
Subject: Last email from me

Hey {first_name},

This is the last email you'll get from me unless you click below.

I'm cleaning my list and removing inactive subscribers.

If you want to keep getting:
- Weekly curated links

Click here: [Keep me subscribed](link)

Otherwise, you'll be automatically removed in 7 days.

No hard feelings either way!

{Your Name}
```

## Emergency Protocols

### If Send Goes Wrong

**Typo in subject/body**:
- Send follow-up: "Oops, typo in the last email..." (humanizes you)
- Don't resend unless critical error

**Broken link**:
- Send immediate correction email
- Subject: "Quick fix: {original subject}"

**Wrong segment sent**:
- Apologize quickly
- If possible, resend to correct segment with note

### Unsubscribe Spike

**If >2% unsubscribe rate**:
1. Review content - was it off-brand or too salesy?
2. Check frequency - did you send too often?
3. Survey leavers: "Sorry to see you go - what went wrong?"

---

Remember: Email is the most direct line to your audience. Respect their inbox, provide value first, and the engagement will follow.
