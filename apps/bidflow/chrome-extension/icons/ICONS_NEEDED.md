# Extension Icons

The Chrome Extension requires the following icon files:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16px (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48px (extension management)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128px (Chrome Web Store)

## Design Guidelines

- Use BIDFLOW brand colors (blue #3b82f6, purple #8b5cf6)
- Include lightning bolt symbol (⚡) to represent AI-powered extraction
- Transparent background
- Clean, modern design

## Temporary Solution

Until icons are created, the extension will use default Chrome icons. The extension is fully functional without custom icons.

## Creating Icons

You can create icons using:
- Figma (recommended)
- Adobe Illustrator
- Canva
- Any image editor that supports PNG export

Export each size separately with transparent backgrounds.
